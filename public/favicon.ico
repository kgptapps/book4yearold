<!-- This is a placeholder for an .ico file -->
<!-- In a real environment, you would convert the SVG to an .ico file -->
<!-- And place it here, but since we can't generate binary files directly -->
<!-- through this interface, this serves as a reminder -->
<!-- You can convert the SVG to ICO using a tool like https://convertico.com/ -->
<!-- or online SVG to ICO converter services -->
